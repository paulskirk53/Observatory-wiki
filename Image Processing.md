From a one shot colour (OSC) FITS image, break the image down into its component R,G,B layers using FITS Liberator see [here](https://remoteastrophotography.com/2021/05/using-fits-liberator-with-rgb-fits-to-create-an-rgb-image)

Then process the R,G, B using photoshop. Adam Block Studios has some really good stuff and I paid for a lifetime subscription ($50) LOgin with Paulskirk53@mailbox.org and the password is ABSKlondyke_1953  note case
