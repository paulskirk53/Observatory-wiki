# ASCOM Driver for Canon
In NINA, the ASCOM driver for the Canon camera is in use. It seems comprehensive and in indoor trial seemed ok capturing images in NINA






# Canon 100D native driver

The information below may be of use if the EOS driver is required for the Canon 1000D

At the start, I tried using the native Canon driver which was in NINA's picklist, however it didn't allow setting the Camera's pixel size and that would be any good for determining plate scale. So I contacted Canon support in May '25 because the EOS utility and camera driver were listed on the Canon download page as incompatible with Win 11.

An extract from the reply I had from Canon is below:
Hello Paul,  
  
I am Dimitris from Canon Services and Support. Rest assured I will do my best to assist you with your **EOS 1000D** inquiry.

Indeed, due to it's age, your camera is not officially supported in the Windows 11 OS. That is the reason you are not able to download any software related to that OS. 

However, since Windows 10 and 11 are very similar in their background processes, you can download the EOS Utility from [here](https://app.ssw.imaging-saas.canon/app/en/eu.html) and then download the Windows 10 updater from [here.](https://www.canon-europe.com/support/consumer/products/cameras/eos/eos-1000d.html?type=software&detailId=tcm:13-1309830&os=Windows%2010%20\(64-bit\)&language=en&productTcmUri=tcm:13-555789) Once the files are downloaded, kindly open them, to begin the installation process.

In most cases, this particular workaround will work, and you will be able to connect your camera with the Utility in your Windows 11 computer.
