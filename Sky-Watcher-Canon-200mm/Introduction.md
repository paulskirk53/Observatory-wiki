The new Skywatcher mount will support the Canon 200mm lens with home made focuser and guide scope adapted from a Celestron guider.

- The software driver used for the mount is the [Green Swamp Software](https://greenswamp.org/) as this has greater functionality than the original skywatcher s/w and was well reviewed.
- The Canon camera driver is the ASCOM one from github, as the Canon EOS driver and utility is not supported by Canon for Windows 11 - great ! However the ASCOM driver looks good when selected in NINA and has captured shots with the 200 mm lems in daylight iso 100 and exposure 0.2 secs.
- Decided to give NINA software a try, lots of good starter videos e.g patriot astro.
