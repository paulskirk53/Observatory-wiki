To Do for the mount

- [ ] Make a fixing for it to accommodate the camera and the autoguider :
	- [ ] Cut the vixen plate to a length which allows it to move in the clamp to facilitate balancing.
	- [ ] The camera and lens weighs 1290 g
	- [ ] the ali bar weight ?
	- [ ] Vixen cut off piece weight?
	- [ ] Autoguider with lodestar weight?
	- [ ] Stepper motor weight?
- [ ] Payload is 5kg but recommendation is 2.5kg for accurate tracking - we'll probably hit that.
