**Q to AI**
here's a problem I'd like help with in NINA. If for instance i were to image a nebula or galaxy which fills the small fov, platesolving often fails. So I need a centreing process that goes to the object, moves away by say 30 arcmin, does a platesolve and if successful moves back to the target. If not successful move another 30 arcmin & try again. Three iterations in total to try to get a PS and move to target.

the AI response turned out to be nonsense as the commands cited don't exist in NINA
