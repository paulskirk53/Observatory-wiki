ZWO guide cam
Pyxis Rotator
Microtouch Focuser
Sabrent Powered Hub
Computer monitor (powered by Victron inverter during setup time, then off)

Before buying a victron DC to DC converter, check that the NUC, powered by the victron inverter does actually work with the SXH814C. Otherwise its back to:
- lenovo which needs 19.5V DC and cannot be powered by the victron DC to DC converter, or 
- buy a Mele or bee computer which runs off 12V
