SXH814C imaging camera currently mains adapter in use with victron inverter
ZWO guide cam usb power

Sabrent Powered Hub currently mains adapter in use with victron inverter
Computer monitor (powered by Victron inverter during setup time, then off)
NUC6CAYH currently mains adapter in use with victron inverter


Before buying a victron DC to DC converter, check that the NUC, powered by the victron inverter does actually work with the SXH814C. Otherwise its back to:
- lenovo which needs 19.5V DC and cannot be powered by the victron DC to DC converter, or 
- buy a Mele or bee computer which runs off 12V
