# Overview
The Observatory has no mains supply, so over a five year period things have evolved. It is challenging and a number of things have been tried including providing mains power from batteries using a Victron inverter. The problems were twofold - one is that the inverters are not very efficient in reality so the batteries discharge quite quickly and second the observatory floor fills with water so the risk of electrocution is too high. So I've settled on two 120 AH batterie in parallel charged by a solar panel & Controller
