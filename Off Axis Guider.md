Looking at the ZWO OAG and lodestar camera in use on the C14, it is often difficult to get guide stars. The problem is the ZWO mirror is 8 x 8 mm but the lodestar chip is small, so only sees part of the ZWO OAG transmitted light field.

I have modelled the fov of the setup in Cartes du Ciel (setup> display> finder rectangle) along with the FOV of the ASKAR M54 OAG and the **ZWO ASI174MM Mini** camera. The latter is virtually twice the field size.
