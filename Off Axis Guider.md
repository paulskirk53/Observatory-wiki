Looking at the ZWO OAG and lodestar camera in use on the C14, it is often difficult to get guide stars. The problem is the ZWO mirror is 8 x 8 mm but the lodestar chip is small, so only sees part of the ZWO OAG transmitted light field.

I have modelled the fov of the setup in Cartes du Ciel (setup> display> finder rectangle) along with the FOV of the ASTROFROG OAG and the **ZWO ASI174MM Mini** camera. The latter is virtually twice the field size.

With the C14 at **f/8**, the **actual guide field of view** through the  OAG prism is approximately: 11.0 × 7.7 arcminutes. (AI)

That’s a noticeable improvement over the ZWO OAG’s ~8.8 × 6.2 arcminutes at f/11, and even more so compared to the Lodestar’s smaller sensor.


**Specs**
Astro Frog OAG is 19.5mm thickness,  cf ZWO OAG  16.5mm thickness
The **ZWO ASI174MM Mini** uses the **Sony IMX174** sensor, and its physical chip size is 11.3 x 7.1 mm


**Spacing**
a set of spacer rings (M42 and M48) allows adjustment of spacing to accommodate the greater thickness of the Astro Frog. This was all completed and focus obtained during October 2025.

**PAR Focus**
This was obtained at the window at home, pointing at houses opposite, taking photos with the SX814C and the ASI guide cam. The helical focuser position for par focus is 6mm mark on the scale.
