Looking at the ZWO OAG and lodestar camera in use on the C14, it is often difficult to get guide stars. The problem is the ZWO mirror is 8 x 8 mm but the lodestar chip is small, so only sees part of the ZWO OAG transmitted light field.

I have modelled the fov of the setup in Cartes du Ciel (setup> display> finder rectangle) along with the FOV of the ASKAR M54 OAG and the **ZWO ASI174MM Mini** camera. The latter is virtually twice the field size.

With the C14 at **f/8**, the **actual guide field of view** through the Askar M54 OAG prism is approximately: 11.0 × 7.7 arcminutes. (AI)

That’s a noticeable improvement over the ZWO OAG’s ~8.8 × 6.2 arcminutes at f/11, and even more so compared to the Lodestar’s smaller sensor.
The **ZWO ASI174MM Mini** uses the **Sony IMX174** sensor, and its physical chip size is:

# **Sensor (chip) size for ZWO ASI174MM Mini: 11.3 mm × 7.1 mm**


**Specs**
ASKAR M54 OAG is 19.5mm thickness

ZWO OAG is 16.5mm thickness
