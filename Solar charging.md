The solar charger for the main battery is Photonic Universe. The circuit has two circuit breakers, one for the battery connection and one for the solar panel connection. Both breakers are mounted on the observatory wall near the Photonic Universe controller.
**Note the following**
**When disconnecting the solar charger:**
Break the Solar panels breaker first, then the battery breaker
**When connecting the solar charger:**
Connect the battery breaker first, then close the solar panel breaker

SO when connecting the solar charging system to charge one of the other batteries, the battery is connected to the Photonic Universe first, then solar panels are connected.

When disconnecting the system, break the solar panels first, then remove the battery.

The reason for this order is that the Photonic Universe needs to configure itself to the battery voltage BEFORE any solar panels are connected.

For the shutter batteris  - two smaller batts on the dome shelf by the shutter, ONE only is connected to the epever controller. If it's required to charge the other battery as will sometimes be necessary, disconnect one and connect the other. Note disconnect and connect process as above.
The 12v Batteries are connected in series when the dome is in use as the stepper motor needs 12v to generate enouh torque to open the shutter.
