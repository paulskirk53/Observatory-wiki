Where to start.
A lot of the electronics is microcontroller related. Once you have learnt about computer programming, microcontrollers are great fun and all kinds of powered stuff can be controlled.

**The caution part**
Be very careful when controlling powered equipment, especially mains powered stuff - you really need to know what you're doing. Switching mains power is a specialist area and I avoided it because of the danger involved if you don't insulate and protect the environment.

The same applies to any DC powered equipment where the DC voltage is over 80 Volts - this can give nasty electrical shocks and cause burns to the skin.

In the observatory, the maximum DC voltage used is 24 Volts and this is harmless if touched with fingers. 

However, the batteries used are substantial capacities of over 100AH and there is a LOT of energy stored in these babies, so it is ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL to avoid short circuits which might occur from dropping a spanner across the battery terminals or connecting wires incorrectly. All wiring in the observatory is colour coded black / red where red is the positive terminal and the wire has an inline fuse, typically 5 amp. Cables are also labelled.

If the batteries are short circuited the wiring will melt and if the wiring is substantial enough to handle the short circuit current which may be 200 to 300 amps, the battery is likely to EXPLODE covering everything in hot sulphuric acid, hot lead metal and hard plastic shards. It's goodbye to life and to the observatory, so best avoided.
