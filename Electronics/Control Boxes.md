One control box services the [[Sitech Telescope]] and another one services the shutter open / close function.

**Function of the box**
The box hosts an AVR4809 microcontroller which is custom programmed by PK via a jtag2UPDI interface - I use an Arduino UNO with the jtag2updi code on it as a programmer for the AVR4809, but any updi programmer will do if ever the contoller needs reprogramming.
The software is on github here
