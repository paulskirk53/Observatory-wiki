The stepper motors used to drive the dome and open/ close the shutter are 8.9 NM - very powerful - **do not get your fingers in the drive mechanism** !

Both motors are connected to commercially available controllers such as the [[DM860I Stepper controller]] as these provide all the drive control and power without reinventing the wheel.
