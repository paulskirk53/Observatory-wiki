A good ebay supplier in birmingham [here](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/365864074198?_skw=100Ah+12V+LITHIUM+LiFePO4+Battery&itmmeta=01K7YVX2T07KQ3GT44C0CHVQA7&hash=item552f32bbd6:g:NhwAAOSwX4Vm4lqV&itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAAA4FkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1ePoWMerqOQrHM1opn9z1z4K89f%2Bztjw0Gr2MSmFAJAG8nXkJQYGnFn2WWLPlfVHi4dCR565DD3fumDjZfwp6A2p8%2BKuvbQp7DRQ5QkrrE8%2BoEIME7Y24Sh6g4kSit5g99JdTZmt06bOri3cEBpt3hmwhUojeBKNVxsnhotCXxxtAuJiEeiI%2F5OJpUk92UAZM9H6SNXIWN70bDJcsaMiSnrQe5C%2Fg8WucC3P1a7nq6EUZvVNmxB9Ff2bmdfXxHT%2Bsn78OxrMb2gxV64hlHDf3fK%7Ctkp%3ABlBMUKSt9Nu_Zg)
### I ordered two on 21st October 2025. The supplier stated the following:
### After receiving the battery, please perform the following steps:  
1. After opening the battery packaging, measure the battery voltage.  
2. Use a standard charger (lithium iron phosphate battery charger with activation functionality) to activate the BMS control system. Recommended voltage range for the charger and discharge equipment: 12.8V battery (10.8V‚Äì14.4V).  
3. Before using the battery, perform a complete charge-discharge aging cycle (the battery has been in transit for a long time, and an aging cycle can better activate the lithium-ion activity of the battery cells).
**I asked AI** 
the battery supplier has provided the above information following my purchase of the Datouboss lifepo4 battery. What is 'activation functionality'? I don't have a specialist charger. 

and got this response:
### üîã What Is Activation Functionality?

- Some LiFePO‚ÇÑ batteries ship with the BMS in a **low-power or sleep state** to prevent discharge or damage.
    
- A charger with ‚Äúactivation functionality‚Äù sends a **brief voltage pulse or current** to **wake up the BMS**, allowing normal charging to begin.
    
- This is especially useful if the battery appears ‚Äúdead‚Äù or won‚Äôt charge immediately after unpacking.
    

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What If You Don‚Äôt Have a Specialist Charger?

No worries ‚Äî many **standard LiFePO‚ÇÑ-compatible chargers or MPPT controllers** (like your **Photonic Universe 40A**) can still activate the BMS if:

- The charger outputs **within the recommended voltage range** (10.8V‚Äì14.4V)
    
- It begins charging with a **gentle ramp-up** rather than a float or trickle mode
    

Your MPPT controller should be fine as long as it‚Äôs:

- Set to a **LiFePO‚ÇÑ charge profile**
    
- Connected to a **solar panel with sufficient input**
    
- Charging during **above-freezing temperatures**
    

### ‚úÖ What You Should Do

1. **Measure voltage**: If it‚Äôs ~12.8V or higher, the battery is likely awake.
    
2. **Connect to your MPPT controller**: Ensure it‚Äôs set to LiFePO‚ÇÑ and has solar input.
    
3. **Observe charging behavior**: If voltage rises steadily, the BMS is active.
    
4. **Perform a full charge-discharge cycle**: This helps balance cells and ‚Äúwake up‚Äù lithium chemistry after transit.
