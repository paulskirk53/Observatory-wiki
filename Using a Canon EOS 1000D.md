The backfocus when using a C14 with the 0.8x reducer, Pyxis Rotator and a Canon EOS 1000D
is made up as follows

The working distance om the surface of the reducer to the chip is 97.5 mm That is manufacturers data from TS Optics, which I know works from the days of the SBIG camera and also the H814C.

So from this page  [[H814C Camera and Log]], in the backfocus section you can see that the following applies when using a Canon Camera:

The sequence of components is C14, 0.8x reducer, rotator, spacer, OAG, Canon Camera, so the working distance of 97.5mm is made up of:

Rotator uses 36.25 mm

Canon uses 44mm of backfocus. (distance from EOS body plate to chip as per manufacturer data)

OAG uses 16.5 mm (from flo web) checked with rule

## EOS Camera Spacer calculation 

Usually a spacer is required to ensure the camera chip sits at the working distance specified by the reducer manufacturer, in this case the spacer turns out to be v small:

**Length of spacer** = 97.5 - 36.25 - 16.5 - 44 = 0.75mm
However I think the T adaptor used to attach the EOS to the optical train takes up more than 0.75 mm, so we'll have to see if attaching the camera works. It will be further away from the reducer than the 97.5mm specified by TS Optics.

Check 0.75 +16.5 + 44 + 36.25 =  97.5
