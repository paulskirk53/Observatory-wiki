THe backfocus when using a C14 with the 0.8x reducer, Pyxis Rotator and A Canon EOS 1000D
is made up as follows

The working distance om the surface of the reducer to the chip is 97.5 mm That is manufacturers data which I know works from the days of the SBIG camera and also the H814C.

So from this page  [[H814C Camera and Log]] in the backfocus section you can see that the following applies when using a Canon Camera:

The sequence of components is c14, 0.8x reducer, rotator, spacer, OAG, Canon Camera, so the working distance of 97.5mm is made up of:

Rotator uses 36.25 mm

Canon uses 44mm of backfocus. (distance from EOS body plate to chip as per manufacturer data)

OAG uses 16.5 mm (from flo web) checked with rule

## Camera Spacer calculation 

Space = 97.5 - 36.25 - 16.5 - 44 = 0.75mm, however I think the T adaptor used to attache the EOS to the optical train takes up more than 0.75 mm, so we'll have to see if attaching the camera works

Check 27.75 +16.5 + 44 + 36.25 =  97.5
