The autoguider software is PHD2 and is very good. The camera used to capture guiding images is the ASI174mm mini (acquired 2025)

Formerly the guide cam was an SX Lodestar. Terry Platt  was the Starlight Express company owner and he was very helpful if repairs were needed or problems arose. He passed away in 2025. There's a help forum.
