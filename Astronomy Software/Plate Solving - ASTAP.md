the ASTAP software website is [here](https://www.hnsky.org/astap.htm#conditions) it can be daunting at first, but it's integrated well with [[Sequence Generator Pro]] . Note the key criteria for successful plate solving on the web page, one of which is the field of view. For the Celestron C14 (I would provide a link but it's all Celestron hype), with the Starlight Express h814C camera and 0.8x reducer, the following applies:

System focal length  3128  mm  (this takes into account the 0.8x reduction)
Camera CD size 12mm x 10 mm (approx) for SX H814C
Field of view is 0.2 degrees x 0.20 degrees approximately, which is great for capturing small objects like galaxies M81, M82, NGC4565 ....

## some config points
in ASTAP settings:
- set FOV as 0.2 degrees
- set downsample to 2
- set use triples - if ASTAP can it will use quads anyway
- Set the smal
