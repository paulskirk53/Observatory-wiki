All software environments need the ASCOM platform to be installed and periodically kept up to date. See [here](https://www.ascom-standards.org/Downloads/ScopeDrivers.htm) 

Paul Kirk wrote an ASCOM Dome driver using the ASCOM developer design templates. It evolved over a few years and it's maintained on Github under paulskirk53 account, along with all the other stuff - microcontroler programs which interface with the dome driver.

If I can be sufficiently motivated, I'll write a list of the software currently in use.
