We use ASTAP and it is good, but our FOV is small so PS is challenging because of small numbers of stars.

If the image does not solve due to poor star shapes, in ASTAP settings use triples instead of quads and set binning = 3 (downsample field)

As a blind solver, ASTAP will work if radius is set to 180 degres. Normally have this set to 30 deg/

As a blind solve failover we use ansvr but it can be slow up to 8 minutes to solv. I am trying to optimise this by removing unused indexes.
