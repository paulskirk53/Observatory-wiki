When entering the observatory to initialise the equipment for an observing session, the following text descibes the workflow.

**Power**
Connect the Main 12 volt battery., by closing the switch connected to the positive 12V battery lead. The circuit is protected by a 5 amp fuse which you can see near the switch. This provides power to the following:
NUC 
Sitech Telescope controller 
USB Hub
Microtouch Focuser
The monitor screen used by the NUC
Note all the above have their own on / off switch too !
The MOSFET switch box which provides power for the Cameras & Rotator see later for how to activate this to provide power for the camera & Rotator.
