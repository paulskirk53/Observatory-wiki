Everything in the observatory is powered by 12 v batteries.

The main battery which powers the mount, camera, focuser and rotator is connected to the Photonic Universe solar charge controller. So that battery gets charge during daylight hours. An equipment test in March 2025 made me decide to add in a buck boost converter to stabilise the battery voltage

The other two batteries for the dome drive are connected in series and supply power to the stepper motor controller [[MA860H]] or similar. These batteries don't get charged directly, so the options for charging are take them home (they weigh a ton) or individually connect them to the Photonic Universe solar charger. This can only be connected to one battery at a time, so give them a sunny day each :)
