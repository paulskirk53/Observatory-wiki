Things to remember

- a small threaded adapter removed from the spacer attached to the 0.8x reducer the threaded adapter has a shim between it and the aluminium tube on the reducer side. The shim is in the SXH814C box.
- Purchased a set of M42 spacers since the main cam needs to move out to facilitate the guide camera being able to move out to achieve focus. So small shims may not be required now that the helical focuser on the OAG can be used (once the m42 spacers arrive)
- The adapter mentioned above is currently attached to the SX nosepiece (from SX blue box) to enable use of the 3 inch refractor.
