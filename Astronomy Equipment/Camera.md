The starlight SX H814C one shot colour camera with cooler

In a cupboard at home is what wea previously used - an SBIG STT8300 RGBI camera and filter wheel. It took some great images, but as the sky became cloudier over the years, it became very difficult to get successive nights on the same object to obtain sufficient images in R, G, and B. That was the main reason for moving to one shot colour (OSC)
