List of problems and solutions.

!st thing as laways with tech stuff, if you can't get it to work by other means, don't forget to try turning it off and back on (cycling the power).
Power cycling is really a last resort as there's so much connected and so much time invested in some aspects of seting up the observatory.

This page is organised by device and sometimes by function, so a device might be problems with the focuser and a function might be problems with platesolving.

**Focuser**
- Q the focuser position is not reported in the client (currently Sequence Generator Pro - SGP)
- A - ensure the power switch for the focuser is on at the focuser box. The focuser will connect via USB without power, but it won't work !
**Sitech controller** 
- Q the telescope won't point at the required object 
	- A1 - Ensure the sitech software is running and connected. 
	- A2 - ensure the controller has been initialised see [[Telescope Initialisation]]
	- A3 - the absolute minimum power supply voltage for the controller is 11.5 V DC. You can run it with a power supply up to 20 volts
- Q - when using the hand controller to move the DEC axis, the scope slows down and starts moving in the other direction.
	- A This is weird but normal. When the scope stops, if you want to continue to move in the same direction press the other DEC key on the handset.
