A strange name for an obsidian note, but it's not as simple as it seems.

So for instance when te dome and scope are both pointing West (Azimuth 270 degrees), the scope won't be aligned with the aperture. Why ? Because of the GEM offsets.

What are GEM offsets? Why am I writing this as the only reader is probably going to be me?

GEM offsets describe the difference  in the positions of the Dome Origin (DO) and Telescope Mount origin. The telescope mount origin (TMO). Ideally, these two points would occupy the same point in space, but unless you're a precision engineer, the likelihood is that they won't, and in our case and many others, they don't. The added complication of a German Equatorial Mount (GEM) also means that even if your TMO and DO occupy the same point in space, there is still an offset due to the mechanical structure of the GEM mount which means that the optical axis is ALWAYS offset from the TMO. Easy stuff of nightmares. So here's what you have to do to set up the GEM offsets for a GEM mount like [[MESU200 mount]] 
- find the DO (use string and the DO is where two diameters at rt angles cross)
- The TMO is the intersection of the RA axis and the DEC axis. Generally it's not an easy spot to define and brain power is needed.
Our process is described here [[Dome  Automation]] and the page identifies the GEM offsets required for our setup with the Pulsar Dome and [[MESU200 mount]].
