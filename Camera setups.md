With the astrofrog OAG

The SXH814C :
M48 20mm spacer in front of oag (telescope side)
ASI guide cam fully in to holder and the helical focuser at 6 gradations out

If a Canon 1000d is substituted, the chip is 44 mm behind the Camera body which is 26.5 mm more than the SXH814C, so to get the right 97.5mm distance from chip to 0.8x reducer we should REMOVE 26.5mm of spacer between 0.8x reducer and CCD
