With the astrofrog OAG and working distance of 97.5mm chip to 0.8x reducer:

**The SXH814C :**
M48 15mm spacer in front of oag (telescope side)
ASI guide cam fully in to holder and the helical focuser at 6 gradations out](<M48x15mm between oag and 0.8x reducer
M42 x 20mm of spacing between OAG body and SX body
ASI Guide cam fully into holder and Helical focuser at 6 gradations>)

**If a Canon 1000d is substituted**, the chip is 44 mm behind the Camera body which is 26.5 mm more than the SXH814C, so to get the right 97.5mm distance from chip to 0.8x reducer we should REMOVE 26.5mm of spacer between 0.8x reducer and CCD
this could be achieved by removing the m48 x 20 (scope side) but the OAG camera's helical focuser interferes with the rotator,
so the only way to do this is to remove the rotator and add a spacer of 30mm
the guide cam
