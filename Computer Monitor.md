The monitor in the observatory is old and uses a 12 volt barrel connector which is ideal for the power arrangements in the obs. However it failed to come on today 27-4-25, which could be the NUC display HDMI port as it's also played up at home, but it got me thinking about replacement monitors with 12v Power this  **KOORUI E2212F 22 Inch FHD Monitor** is one that copilot found - around £70 on ebay 

Whilst the Victron Inverter is in place it makes sense to use a mains powered monitor as its only on for very short periods.
