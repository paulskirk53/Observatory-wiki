The monitor in the observatory is old and uses a 12 volt barrel connector which is ideal for the power arrangements in the obs. However it failed to come on today 27-4-25, which could be the NUC display HDMI port as it's also played up at home, but it got me thinking about replacement monitors with 12v Power this  **KOORUI E2212F 22 Inch FHD Monitor** is one that copilot found - around Â£70 on ebay
