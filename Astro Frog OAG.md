So new calculation of spacer length for Astro Frog OAG:

TS Optics spec for distance from face of reducer to CCD plane= 97.5mm

- astro frog thickness = 20
- Pyxis thickness = 25
- Trius backfocus= 17
Length of spacer = 97.5 - 20 - 25 -17 = 35.5

check 35.5 + 20+25+17 = 97.5 

The joy temporarily was that because of the measurement mistake, the existing spacer is the correct length for the new Astro Frog. This does of course beg the question of how well the system was working with an incorrect length spacer - as the distance from the reducer to the CCD @ 97.5 is supposed to be critical....
However, the ASI guide cam reaches focus when the mirror stem is fully into the light cone. If the stem is moved out, the camera moves out too, and needs to be moved back in which it can't do due to physical constraint, so the light path to the main camera will need to be lengthened with an M42 spacer, which of course uses up backfocus, so the main spacer will still need to be shortened by the length of whatever we need to add in to make the cameras parfocal. 

Work out how much using the refractor setup at home.
