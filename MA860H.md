This is the stepper motor controller - there are two, one for dome and one for shutter the names of newer devices may be different

See [here](https://www.omc-stepperonline.com/download/MA860H.pdf) for the user manual, it looks like this:

**CoPilot AI advice on setting up the MA860H and stepper**

Using a 24V supply for your 34HS46-5004D stepper motor and MA860H controller is a solid choice. Here's how you can fine-tune your setup for optimal performance:

1. Current Setting: Set the MA860H controller's current limit to match the motor's rated current of 5A. This ensures the motor operates efficiently without overheating.
    
2. Microstepping: Adjust the microstepping settings on the controller. Higher microstepping (e.g., 1/8 or 1/16) provides smoother motion and better precision but may slightly reduce torque. Choose a setting that balances your application's needs for torque and smoothness.
    
3. Acceleration and Deceleration: Gradually ramp up and down the speed to avoid losing steps. The MA860H allows you to configure acceleration profiles to match your motor's capabilities.
    
4. Cooling: Since you're using a lower supply voltage, the motor may draw higher current to maintain torque, leading to heat buildup. Ensure adequate cooling for both the motor and controller.
    
5. Wiring and Connections: Use thick, low-resistance wires to minimize voltage drops, especially with a 24V supply. Secure all connections to prevent intermittent issues.
    
Testing and Adjustment: Start with conservative settings and gradually increase speed and acceleration while monitoring the motor's performance. Listen for smooth operation and check for overheating.
