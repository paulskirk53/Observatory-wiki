- [ ] ~={red}On the night of 17th May, guiding was good then bad with no star seemingly available and focussing half flux radius was all over the place, with masses of 'stars' so do the following=~
	- [x] check dome and scope alignment with some slews in daytime - done and was good
	- [ ] check oag fixing as it wobbles - tighten the grub screw
	- [ ] check oag depth into image cone
- [ ] - 
- [x] set 2x2 binning in camera tab
- [ ] take up some drawing pins
- [ ] paint the observatory walls
- [ ] Check the meridian flip settings in Sitech don't conflict with SGP - that may have been the problem on 5-5-25
