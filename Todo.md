recheck the dome geometry:
things to take
tape measure with lock facility
spirit level
long timber about 90 cm to 1 metre
fishing weight
paper clip to mark 1.1 metre point on string for U/D measurement
procedure:
	- install plumb line
	- measure with tape & level to ensure plumb is centred in dome NESW and also to measure accurately how much offset there is due to plumb/ mount interference
	- make sure the measurements taken are in NESW directions
	-
