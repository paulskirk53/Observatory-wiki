* Check the new driver amendments re dome geometry and sync to azimuth. Hopefully the dome positioning will be more accurate. Try positions at NSEW
* Check the radio box works - tested at home fine - a new switch has been installed on the box which has a normal and override position. In the override position the shutter is always reported to ascom driver as open. It's a way of being able to keep going with imaging if the bluetooth or something shutter related goes awry. Shutter must be opened and closed manually by hand.
* take up some drawing pins
* Paint the walls of the building

recheck the dome geometry: - **done 10th April 2025 new values here** [[Dome  Automation]]
things to take
string
tape measure with lock facility
spirit level
long timber about 90 cm to 1 metre
fishing weight
paper clip to mark 1.1 metre point on string for U/D measurement
procedure:
- # first - move the dome by hand through 360 to check azimuth is consistent - done and a complete rotation was perfect
	- Move scope horizontal
	- install plumb line
	- measure with tape & level to ensure plumb is centred in dome NESW and also to measure accurately how much offset there is due to plumb/ mount interference if necessary
	- make sure the measurements taken are in NESW directions
	- scope east of dome O is +
	- scope north of dome O is +

**March 2025**
1. Install the buck boost for the dome drive **done** Apr 2025
2. Ditto for the main equipment battery when it arrives. **done**
3. Get a box for the new buck boost device **done**
4. Try out the dome drive to see if it syncs with the telescope, following the updates to the GEM  offsets - done in ASCOM device hub and also in SGP. done, pretty good except N direction.
