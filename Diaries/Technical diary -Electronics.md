## Dome drive
The field test showed the dome drive motor turned in the wrong direction so needs a field pair swapping e.g. swap A+ and A- (done & worked)
Also the encoder wiring - one lead had broken. - now repaired.

## Dome drive
Finally the dome drive is functional in as far as when its connected to power and the NUC, it will drive the stepper motor with torque such that it cannot be stopped by hand. Using an arduino sermon issuing commands Sl# (slew status) and SA270# (slew to azimuth) worked fine with acceleration and deceleration. Power supply was two 100AH batteries in series and a DM860I controller borrowed from the shutter. The above was at home, so now need to take it all back to observatory and use ASCOM Device hub to connect and slew to a target. Do some in daylight to check out positioning.
