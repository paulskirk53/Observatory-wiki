A lot has happened, in the period since the last entry on 18th March an update below
It has been a frustrating time as the night sky has been clear for about three weeks due to high pressure. Her's the problems:

Camera would not work 814C would not connect. Discussions with Terry Platt tried install of drivers, no joy. Decided to try installing the drivers on the WIN 10 dev m/c and the camera connected and continued to connect when transferred back to the NUC where there had beenn no changes. I have no idea what's going on. Greg is phasing out the SX cams and using the ZWO aps cmos chips instead. Good idea. So camera now working :)

Tuesday - a lovely blue sky day and same at night. h814C Camera connected but a 90 second image of a starry sky was jet black. Lodestar would not connect.
I think this is a battery voltage issue. I used Sitech  servoconfig to check the battery volts at the controller and it was 11.7. This is too low for Sitech really.

So I bought a buck boost [device](https://kunkune.co.uk/shop/dc-to-dc-converters/250w-10a-boost-converter-step-up-module-8-48v-to-12-50v-adjustable/) after talking with copilot AI. I can set this at 13.5v o/p and it will provide a stable voltage up to 10 A current. I think the max current spike we'd get is around 6 amps.
