The observatory computer is a NUC the password to get into it is 3633
It runs Windows 11 as of Feb 2025
It has the ASCOM platform installed (essential for most other programs to integrate)

It also has the following software installed
Sequence generator Pro - I have paid for three licences, this is the equipment and image capture management software. It's been around for 10 years or so and works well for astro imaging.
ASTAP plate solving s/w
PHD2 autoguiding software
Microtouch focuser software and drivers - the focuser is closely integrated with SGP  which autofocuses well as long as the sct is close to focus - no doughnut stars.
Pyxis camera rotator software - again closely integrated with SGP
Sitech Telescope control software - closely integrated with SGP  :)

My own software for remote management of the entire observatory from home. This is called 'monitoring' and was written as a winforms application in C#
