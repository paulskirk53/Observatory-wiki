Sitech is the electronics and software which comes with the [[MESU200 mount]] when purchased new in 2014 Note that the MINIMUM supply voltage for the sitech controller is 12v. If it falls under that it becomes unstable...so important to keep the main battery attached to the photonic universe charger well charged.
