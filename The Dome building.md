cOriginally the observatory was in the garden of Pitton Mill Cottage Rhossilli
It went through a few designs from starting as the converted Wendy house, to the roll off roof, then the polycarbonate dome which leaked and then the custom fibreglass coated cardboard which distorted badly.

The earliest building was the former Wendy House that Mairwen let me use.
Shown below wtih the early Gemini Telescope mount around 2012. This set up took some nice images with the 6 inch helios then the celestron C11 SCT.
